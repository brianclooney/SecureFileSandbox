# SecureFileSandbox

SecureFileSandbox is a personal learning project focused on exploring C# development and deployment across various environments. This project serves as my laboratory for experimenting with C# and .NET technologies, featuring a server and multiple client applications, each representing a different aspect of .NET application development. This setup allows me to gain hands-on experience with both back-end and front-end technologies.

## Project Overview

### Server
- **SecureFileServer**: A backend server developed in C# to provide API endpoints. This server is a testbed for understanding RESTful service design, data handling, and security implementation in .NET.

### Clients
- **SecureFileDesktop**: A desktop client built with WPF, designed to explore rich client-side functionality and user interface design in a Windows environment.
- **SecureFileConsole**: A console-based application that allows for command-line operations and scripting, perfect for testing the functionality of backend services in a simple, direct manner.
- **SecureFileRazor**: A web client implemented using Razor Pages to understand server-rendered UI concepts and form handling in ASP.NET Core.
- **SecureFileBlazor**: A Blazor single page application that delves into client-side C# capabilities, focusing on interactive web UIs and real-time data management without traditional JavaScript frameworks.

## Learning Objectives

- **C# Proficiency**: Enhancing knowledge and skill in C# through diverse applications.
- **.NET Ecosystem Familiarity**: Gaining a comprehensive understanding of the .NET architecture, including front-end technologies like Blazor and server-side frameworks like ASP.NET Core.
- **Development & Deployment**: Exploring various deployment scenarios and configurations to understand the lifecycle of software development from code to production.
- **Security Implementations**: Learning to implement basic security practices in web and desktop applications.
